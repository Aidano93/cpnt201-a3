A 'flip color scheme' button has been provided at the top of the page to toggle between the default and secondary color scheme. Click the button to toggle. Doing so changes the fill colors of each path in the svg, as well as the background color of the svg wrapper div.

The source svg for this graphic can be found in the assets/logos folder.
